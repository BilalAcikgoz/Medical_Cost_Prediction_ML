# Medical_Cost_Prediction_ML
  Hello everyone!! I will explain what do I in this readme file. Firstly, we examined our dataset. There are 7 columns in the dataset. Target variable is charges. So our aim is to estimate medical cost. After that examine dataset, we must do EDA and visualization.
They will give more information about dataset. Then we must do scale and encoding for better learning of machine learning algorithms because a lot of algorithms want to encoding and scaling. Later we applied machine learning algorithms on the dataset. if we look 
at the results, the best algorithm is gradient boosting machine. It uses enseble learning methods so this type algorithms usually success in the a lot of datasets.
